    'Artificial Intelligence‚Äîor AI‚Äîis one of those terms that sounds complicated, futuristic, and maybe even a little scary. But here‚Äôs the truth: AI is just a fancy way of saying ‚Äúmachines that learn from patterns.‚Äù\nFor example, when your phone suggests the next word while you‚Äôre typing, or when Netflix recommends a show you actually like‚Äîthat‚Äôs AI at work. It studies your behavior, spots patterns, and tries to predict what you want.\nSo should you be worried about AI taking over the world? Probably not. The real concern isn‚Äôt evil robots‚Äîit‚Äôs how we use AI. Are companies using your data responsibly? Are decisions being made fairly? These are the real questions we should be asking.\nThe good news is: AI isn‚Äôt magic. It‚Äôs made by people, and that means we can shape how it works. Staying curious and informed is the best way to make sure AI helps us, not harms us.',
